# UI Prototype

This project has a mockup prototyped with Google Stitch, composed of several screens that show the user interface of the web app.

## Screens

The mockup includes the following screens:

- Home Screen: This screen shows a summary of the app and its features.

  **NOTE**: The layout of the header and footer has to be based on the design shown in this screen, so it is important to ignore these sections in the next screens.

- CDT Submenu Screen: This screen allows the user to navigate to the CDT-related features.
